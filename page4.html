    <center><h1>ARJUN DAS</h1></center>

    <p>Arjun Das is an Indian actor who predominantly works in Tamil films, along with a few Telugu films. He has garnered major attention for his bass voice

        Arjun made his acting debut in the suspense thriller Perumaan (2012). Following a few other movies and a short film, he appeared in Lokesh Kanagaraj's Kaithi, portraying a cocaine addict gang leader and then collaborated with Lokesh again for the film Master portraying Das.</p>

        <p>Scouted by Lokesh Kanagaraj for Kaithi, Arjun was initially hesitant to sign the film, due to the importance and substance of the character. After auditioning with a scene that didn't make it to the film's final cut, he landed a role as the main antagonist in the film[8]. Quoting Dhanush as his inspiration, he claims that he is not the type to seriously prepare for any scene, however, he did conduct basic research to get into the skin of the character, with emphasis on the behaviour of drug use. He received abundant appreciation for his role and voice in Kaithi, following which he was once again roped in by Lokesh Kanagaraj for Master.[9][10][11] Often attributing his talent and fame to Lokesh Kanagaraj, Arjun has expressed his gratefulness to him for the role of Das in Master, for which he was called a few days after the commencement of shoot. His piercing glares and iconic voice in the film[12] set him aside from the rest of the varied cast, as he portrays a sub-antagonist role responsible for controlling the children of a juvenile centre with the influence of drugs.
